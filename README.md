# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Big Data Tools

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the big data and integration tools to build a scalable and real-time fraud detection pipeline for credit card transactions.
It utilizes distributed data storage - HDFS, batch processing tools - Hive, Pig, real-time data streaming - Kafka, and machine learning to detect fraudulent behavior in credit card usage.

The goal is to simulate a real-world financial fraud detection system that can analyze massive transaction volumes and raise alerts in real time.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** from Kaggle:

- Source: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Description**: The dataset contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with 284,807 transactions and 492 labeled frauds.
- For size and convenience, the dataset is included in compressed format:  `data/creditcard.csv.zip`
- Before using the data, unzip it:
- ```bash
unzip data/creditcard.csv.zip

As a second datset for this pproject we are using **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from kaggle:

-source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023?select=creditcard_2023.csv
- **Description**: This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders in the year 2023. It comprises over 550,000 records, and the data has been anonymized to protect the cardholders' identities. The primary objective of this dataset is to facilitate the development of fraud detection algorithms and models to identify potentially fraudulent transactions.
- Data is attached externally through google drive
