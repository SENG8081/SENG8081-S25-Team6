# Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Big Data Tools

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the big data and integration tools to build a scalable and real-time fraud detection pipeline for credit card transactions.
It utilizes distributed data storage - HDFS, batch processing tools - Hive, Pig, real-time data streaming - Kafka, and machine learning to detect fraudulent behavior in credit card usage.

The goal is to simulate a real-world financial fraud detection system that can analyze massive transaction volumes and raise alerts in real time.

## 🧪 Dataset

This project uses the **Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset** from Kaggle:
